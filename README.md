# 🎈 Post Apocalloon

**Post Apocalloon** is a fast-paced infection arcade minigame where you play as a **virus balloon** in a desolate, post-apocalyptic world.

Your mission? Infect as many clean balloons as possible before time runs out!

## 🦠 Power-Ups and Abilities

Across the map, you can find four types of power-ups that activate on contact:

- **Speed Boost** — *Stackable*. Move faster, infect faster.
- **Virus Nuke** — Infects all balloons in a blast radius.
- **Virus Attack** — Launch 4 virus buds in different directions. They infect anything in their path.
- **Time Freeze** — Stop the timer for a short time.

Each infected balloon will also spread the virus to nearby uninfected balloons, creating satisfying chain reactions.

## 🎮 How To Play

- Move using **WASD**
- Infect clean balloons
- Collect power-ups
- Chain infections for massive spread
- Climb the **local leaderboard**!

> Strategy matters — will you follow a calculated path to clear the map efficiently, or chase down random power-ups to dominate the chaos?
